# When's Brexit?
## A simple "API" to give info about Brexit.

You know things aren't going so great when you need an API to determine the state of the country. This is that. It's not much of an API - it's a static JSON file - but it's a single source of truth that shoud hopefully help people build useful things on top of it.

Contributions are welcome!
